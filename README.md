Module 2 Challenge

Write a script that will iterate over multiple worksheets.
Add two summary charts
One that calcuates the change from starting opening price in comparision to the last day's closing price. 
Calculate the percentage change (change/opening price)*100%
Calculate the total stock volume over a period of time.

Create a second summary chart that analyzes the data from the first chart created to output the greatest % increase, decrease and greatest total stock volume. 

Solution Notes:
alphabetical_testing_Phipps has 3 modules within it. 
The 1st module shows the code that will do the first chart minus creating the headers using script (I figured that out in Module 3)
The 2nd module shows the code that will do the first summary chart and the second smaller one.
The 3rd module shows the code that will iterated over all the worksheets and also will add the headers for the new summary charts
Multiple_year_stock_data has 1 module that uses the same code as module 3 above.
